      `Attributes describe each field — each piece of data — related to an object. When defining an attribute, you must specify the type of the data
      represented by an attribute. For example, if you want to store a user's email address, you would define an attribute called "email" and set the
      data type to text. All data types and their descriptions are listed below.`,

      `Text — Specifies attributes that contain textual data`,

      `Integer - Specifies attributes that contain whole numbers (..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...)`,

      `Decimal - Specifies attributes that contain fractional numbers (Eg: 0.4, -1.3, etc.)`,
